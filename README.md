# ***Stores***

This a repo for me and @Goredbirds game. This game is called stores. Go Yankees

Read the <a href="https://github.com/StevenCopeland/Stores/wiki">Stores Wiki</a> for more.

## Rules
<hr/>
<h2>You and three other nefarious business-men with expensive suits are racing to be the first to own $500,000</h2>
<ul id="rules">
<li>The goal of the game is to earn $500,000 as quick as possible.</li>
<li>You start out with 15 dollars.</li>
<li>Every turn, you choose how many workers to buy. Workers cost 20 dollars each.</li>
<li>For every worker you buy, your productivity increases.</li>
<li>Whoever gets $500,000 first, wins!</li>
<!--<li>(Coming soon!) If you have $50 at the end of the round then you will be able to buy one/many employees</li>-->
</ul>
